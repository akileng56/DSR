Message: is a string sent between nodes via a UDP socket.
	
	Leading character of a message block should be a '#'

DSR Message: Starts with the characters 'dsr'
		
	Route-Request Message: 'dsr-req-.....'
	Route-Reply   Message: 'dsr-rpy......'
	Route-Error   Message: 'dsr-err......'
	
DSR Route Request:
	
	Initiator - ID of the node looking for the destination: 	(8 bit number)
	Destination for which the discovery is looking: 		(8 bit number)
	Unique ID generated by initiator: 				(8 bit number)
	Max Hops for the request (TTL)					(8 bit number)
	N Number of attached node IDs for nodes relayed.		(n*8 bit numbers)
	
	            Initiator       Dest.         ID.       Max Hops     N Number of attached IDs.

DSR Route Reply:
	
	Replyer ID - Node with a valid route to the destination: 		(8 bit number)
