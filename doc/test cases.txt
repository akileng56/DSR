1.
short path - make the shortest neighbour as the prefered path
2.
broken link - still prefer short neighbour, but send through the next short neighbour
continuing infinity - sending through next path ...algorithm is...using short path +1 on so on
then updates routing table
until the cost of link n2-n1 is less than cost of n2-n3
3.
responding to topology changes
then any route through that hop is given infinity distance (considered as major changes
and immediately broadcasted)

routing table updated and in the future, no longer using broken path (using new information)

------------------------------
dsdv
6.
route advertisement broadcast by each
mobile node has the following information for
each new route :
– The destination’s address
– The number of hops to the destination
– The sequence number of the information received
from that destination. This is the original sequence
number assigned by the destination (DSDV)
7.
topology changes-full dump vs. incremental dump (if size of incremental dump is large,
then use full dump)
The sequence number of the current dump from j
is compared with previous dumps from j
– If the sequence number is new, the route table at i
is updated with this new information.
– Node i now broadcasts its new route table as an
incremental or a full dump.

8.

Broadcast frequency-
A node decides on a new route based on one of
the two criteria 
– If a route has a smaller metric (distance) to a
destination
– Or, if an update from the destination with a new
sequence number has been received.
 However, it is not desirable that a node
broadcasts an update every time it has updated
its routing table

9.
reduce the number of updates-
A node i may receive the same update
message from another node j through several
different paths.
 Suppose, one of the updates has a lowest
distance to j
 It is better to avoid broadcasting every new
update and instead broadcast only the lower
metric updates.
wait longer to get an updates greater than 30sec

DSR DSR DSR
10.
All routing is automatically determined by the
protocol.

11.
start with-route discovery phase,-discovered path-and send msg

12.
Promiscuous mode of operation-Each node gathers information about the
network topology by overhearing other nodes’
transmissions.

13.
route cache-Each node maintains a route cache to
remember routes that it has learnt about

14.
the
number of control messages is much smaller.
Hence DSR is more energy-efficient and does
not congest the network with too many control
messages.

15.
a-b-c-d-e
route reply (route is discocevered completely)
A is trying to find a route to E
Each intermediate node appends its ID at the end.
E knows the reverse route and sends a route reply

16.
route discovered partially
A is trying to find a route to E
C already has a route to E in its route cache.
C sends back the complete route to A

17.
unique id
Each node selects a single IP address by which
it is known in the network.
 This is necessary for assigning a unique ID for
each node.
 Each node may or may not work in the
promiscuous mode. 

18.
route maintenance
When S is using a discovered
route to D, S may detect that the route is broken. In
such cases, S may use an alternate route to D (if it is
known), or start another route discovery phase to D.

19.
on-demand attribute
route discovery and route maintenance operate on-demand
no need to broadcast periodically to
update routing information in individual nodes

20.
number of packets
The number of overhead packets is much
smaller in DSR. The number of overhead
packets drop to zero when the nodes are static
and all routes have been discovered

21.
When nodes are mobile and/or communication
pattern changes, the number of overhead
packets increase proportionately.
 It is necessary to discover new routes in these
situations and hence the new route discovery
packets are the overhead packets.
 Note that, a node may receive multiple routes to
a destination in response to a route discovery
request.

22.
route cache
multiple routes to a
destination in its route cache.
 A node can react to changes in network topology
much more rapidly by taking advantage of
cached routes.
 For example, if one route to a destination is
broken, the source node can choose another
route to the destination from its route cache.
--S already knows a route to
D from its route cache.
 In this case, S will add the sequence of hops to
D in the header of the packet. Then S will send
the packet to the first node in this sequence.

23.
route cache not available
start with route discovery protocol
S broadcasts a route request message to its
neighbours. This message is received by all
nodes within the transmission range of S.
 Each route request message contains the
initiator and target of the route discovery.
 Also, each route request is stamped with a
unique ID assigned by the initiator.

24.
route request
Every node that receives a route request
message, does one of the following :
– A node like B first searches its route cache to see
whether it has a stored route to D. If it has such a
route, B sends that route to S.
– If there is no such route in its route cache, B
broadcasts the route request message to its
neighbours. B attaches its own ID to the route request
message

When a Route Request message reaches a
node, the accumulated route indicates the nodes
through which it has passed.
 This accumulated route is used by a node to
send a Route Reply message back to the
initiator.
 The Route Reply message can be sent either by
the destination node or by an intermediate node
that finds a route to the destination in its route
cache

25.
route discovery frequency
If S does not receive a route reply message, S
would like to initiate another route request
message.
 However, S should not send route request
messages frequently, because D may be
unreachable at the moment.

S should not flood the network with route requests

26.
route reply storm
A node can send a route reply if it finds a route
to the target in its route cache.
 However, if many nodes try to send route reply
for the same destination, it may result in a route
reply storm.
 Too many replies for the same route request
may flood the network.

27.
waiting before replying
Simultaneous replies from all these nodes will
result in network congestion and packet
collisions.
 Each node should wait for a random amount of
time and listen to the traffic.
 If there is a better (shorter) route reply, or the
initiator (node A in this example) starts using
another route, there is no need to reply.

28.
route cache updates
An important aspect of DSR is to maintain an
up-to-date route cache.
 A good and current route cache helps a node to
find (i) routes for itself faster, and (ii) reply fast to
route request messages.
 If the nodes overhear other messages, they
should analyse these messages and update
their own route cache if necessary

29.
overhead routing information
P overhears the route A-B-C-D-E when B is sending a
packet to C. This packet was originally sent by A.
P stores this route in its route cache for future use. If P
receives a route request for any of the destinations C,D or
E, P can use this information



30.
route request hop limit
Suppose S is the source of a route request
message for a destination D.
 In case D is in the neighbourhood of S, the route
request message from S should not propagate
too far away
propagating the route request
message too far will result in too many
unnecessary route reply messages in future.



31.
Restricted Propagation of Route Request
A better strategy is to propagate route request
messages with increasing hop count.
 Initially, send the route request to a distance of 2
hops. If no route reply is received after
sometime, send the route request to a distance
of 4 hops and so on.
 This reduces network congestion by reducing
the number of route reply messages.




32.
Active acknowledgement
A is responsible for the correct delivery of the packet to B
B is responsible for the correct delivery of the packet to C
and so on.
restransmit message fixed number of times is no acknowledgement arrives

Passive acknowledgement
In a passive acknowledgment, node A may
overhear the forwarding of the packet by node B
and knows that the packet has been received by
B
